## <a name=need>These sites need to be added </a>

Actually there are many sites which doesn't use responses instead use error messages. 

So making a list of them won't make sense untill the [feature](https://github.com/7rillionaire/Search4/blob/master/TODO.md) is added? Which is W.I.P

But soon after the feature is added [this](#need) part will be merged in to [Supported sites](#supported).
